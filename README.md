# Purpose

I created this app called Landscape as my final project for my web development bootcampe at CodeCore (www.codecore.ca).

Technologies used:
* HTML and CSS
* Javascript, jQuery, and Chart.js
* Ruby on Rails
* Postgres

# What is Landscape?

Landscape is an analytical tool that gives you different perspectives of your business environment of suppliers, competitors, and clients.
Imagine a version of Salesforce that is designed for tracking your suppliers and competitors, and not just clients.

# View by organization

Compare organizations to view two companies' details side by side.
Use an advanced search to compile a list of orgs according to your criteria, in as much detail as you desire.

Or use the simple search features. View an org from the drop-down menu on the top right. You can also see all of the database's orgs here.

# Analyze a market

Specify the type of market that you want to view and summarize the data with pie charts.
For instance, you may want to view all electronics sales across Canada or all sales in Alberta.
